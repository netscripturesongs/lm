      <p class = "devoh">40 Days of my Emmaus Road Project</p>
      <p class = "devo">In John 5:39 Jesus is responding to very educated Jewish religious leaders: - "You study the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify about me,"
        The "Scriptures" he referenced above could have only been those read from ancient scrolls since the New Testament had not yet been written.  But after it was written,connections between Jesus and the Scriptures are referred to in many instances.  I hope to share those connections and to fill in some blanks or provide more detail for those not specifically expounded upon.
        With a complete Bible and many resources, we have the opportunity to look these things up for ourselves.  What especially caught my curiosity was when Jesus was speaking with two men on the road to Emmaus the very day he had resurrected.  He kept his identity hidden, but in response to the discussion of recent events "beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself." (Luke 24:27) Oh how I wish all of what He said had been included, but as stated in the book of John 21:25, "Jesus did many other things as well.  If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written."
        That's what this 40 day project is about.  Each day I will provide something that reveals a connection between Jesus and the prophecies, foreshadowing, types, etc.  For your convenience , in most cases, I have included the actual scripture so it does not have to be looked up.  To be mostly consistent in translation, I have chosen the NIV version.  I have gathered from numerous sources, the scriptures that apply.  It is mostly in sequential order but at times I've chosen to follow a theme instead.  May you be blessed as you take this journey with me and the many others who have wondered about the mysteries of these ancient predictions.
        P.S. These are only in draft form.  A lot still has to be tweaked before I put it on my website.  I planned for the 40 days to begin on the day after the Jewish holiday, Purim.  It would begin Thursday March 8th and end a week after Easter, April 16th on the Sunday after Easter.  The 40 days include weekends.  It is exactly 40 days. Some give up something for lent.  Consider adding this meditation for a fuller experience.
        Please let me know if anything needs to be brought to my attention.  I am in the process of learning these things myself. Contact me, Leanet, at

      <p class="devo"><strong>ERP Day 1  Morning of Resurrection, Luke 24:1-8   or Dawn </strong><br><br>
        1)  On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb. 2) They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, 3)  but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. 4) While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them. 5) In their fright the women bowed down with their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, “Why do you look for the living among the dead? 6) He is not here; he has risen!  Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee: 7) ‘The Son of Man must be delivered over to the hands of sinners, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.’ ” 8) Then they remembered his words.
        Soon after Jesus had asked the disciples who they thought he was, Peter clarified, "You are the Messiah, the Son of the Living God." in Matthew 16:16,
        came Matthew 16:21 - "From that time on Jesus began to explain to is disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life."
        So that's what the angels were talking about! "Then they remembered his words."  (Luke 24:8 ) and  the women ran to tell the others! 
      </p>
      <p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 2.  Resurrection Day at Dusk</strong><br><br>
        Around dusk, Jesus was taking a walk the road to Emmaus.  Why?  It must have been a divine appointment because I have no idea why else he would be seven miles away from Jerusalem.  Also, as soon as he finished his "appointment" he disappeared into thin air later that evening.  I love this record of Jesus going to the place where two very devastated men would be trying to work though what had happened with Jesus over the past several days.  It's like he wanted to surprise them and personally give them an update!  The funny part is that he disguised himself somehow and pretended to know nothing.  And that is so funny to me considering he knew everything about it!  He must have really enjoyed asking, "What news?"  as if he was completely clueless!  Then at the end, he spoke intelligently about how the Jesus they are talking about really did fulfill the Law of Moses and the Prophets and even his own predictions and it ALL NEEDED TO HAPPEN to fulfill Scripture!
        Luke 24:13-27 Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem. They were talking with each other about everything that had happened. As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them; but they were kept from recognizing him. He asked them, “What are you discussing together as you walk along?” They stood still, their faces downcast.
        One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, “Are you the only one visiting Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?” “What things?” he asked.
        “About Jesus of Nazareth,” they replied. “He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people. The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him; but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. And what is more, it is the third day since all this took place. In addition, some of our women amazed us. They went to the tomb early this morning but didn’t find his body. They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive. Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but they did not see Jesus.”
        He said to them, “How foolish you are, and how slow to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Did not the Messiah have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?” And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself."  
      <p class = "devo"><strong>Day 3 ERP  Resurrection Evening Luke 24:28-45</strong><br><br>  
        What happened when the two men on the Emmaus Road invited "this stranger" to their home for dinner?
        28)  As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus continued on as if he were going farther. 29)  But they urged him strongly, “Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over.” So he went in to stay with them. 30)  When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them. 31)  Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight. 32)  They asked each other, “Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?”
        
        33) They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together 34) and saying, “It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.”
        So, from this it is obvious what Jesus had been doing in the afternoon; appearing to Simon!  And who knows what else!  But now the eleven and the two Emmaus road disciples are together and Jesus appears again!
        Their reactions to the women had been disbelief.   When Jesus appeared to the group in person, they were also in disbelief, (vs.37 )- "They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost.  Jesus did three things to prove he was not a ghost:  
        1.  Look at my hands and feet  (vs.39)
        2.  Touch me and see:  a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.
        3.  He ate in front of them.   vs.41) "And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked them, "Do you have anything here to eat?  (vs.42) They have him a piece of broiled fish, (vs.43) and he took it and ate it in their presence.
        44 He said to them, “This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.”
        45 Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures. 
      </p>
      <p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 4 - Jesus in the Law of Moses?</strong><br><br> 
        The Jewish leaders who were often challenging Jesus got this reply when they refused to accept him,
        in John 5:39-40  "You study the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify about me, yet you refuse to come to me that you might have life."
        and John 5:45-46  “But do not think I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, on whom your hopes are set. 46) If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me."
        The first five books of the Bible are known as the law of Moses or the Torah (Hebrew) or Pentateuch (Greek) Jesus said in Luke 24:44-45, "This is what I told you while I was still with you:  Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms. 45)Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures."
        (When Jesus mentions Scripture, it can only be the Old Testament since the New Testament was not yet written)
        Let's pray that in this 40 day Emmaus Road quest that God will "open our minds as well to understand the Scriptures.
        (Feel free to compare with other translations.  I have used the NIV.  But others can be helpful as well.  The Living Bible says in Psalm 119:18-19, "Open my eyes to see wonderful things in your Word. 19) I am but a pilgrim here on earth; how I need a map-and your commands are my chart and guide.")
        Let's begin!
        These are just A FEW examples of Jesus in the books of Moses!  It's just a sneak peek of Jesus throughout all Scripture!
        Genesis 3:15 prophecies about the "seed of the Woman" who will crush the serpent's head while bruising his own heel.  (sound familiar?)
        Exodus 12:3 explains the Passover Lamb and John 19:36 shows one aspect of the fulfillment.
        Leviticus 1-7 sacrificial system is fulfilled in Jesus Hebrews 9:13-14
        Numbers 21:4-9 the one raised up for all to look upon is referred to by Jesus in John 3:14
        Deuteronomy 27 is the law fulfilled in Jesus - Matthew 5:17 
      </p>
      <p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 5 The SEED prophecy:  The Three Patriarchs Wives</strong><br><br>
        The first promise of a coming Messiah through a SEED is in Genesis 3:15.  
        To the serpent, God said, "And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her Seed; He shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.  And when Jesus came, as Isaiah 53:5 says, "He was bruised for our iniquities.  The serpent's head was also bruised at that time.
        Galatians 3:16 explains that the Scripture does not say, "and to seeds," meaning many, but "and to your seed, meaning One, who is Christ."
        SARAH:  The seed or lineage of the Messiah was promised to miraculously come through Abraham's barren wife Sarah and no other woman.  Genesis 17:17-21
        17 Abraham fell facedown; he laughed and said to himself, “Will a son be born to a man a hundred years old? Will Sarah bear a child at the age of ninety?” 18 And Abraham said to God, “If only Ishmael might live under your blessing!” 19 Then God said, “Yes, but your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you will call him Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him. 20 And as for Ishmael, I have heard you: I will surely bless him; I will make him fruitful and will greatly increase his numbers. He will be the father of twelve rulers, and I will make him into a great nation. 21 But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you by this time next year.”
        REBECCA:  Isaac’s Rebecca  who was clearly chosen by the Lord (account in Genesis 24). had a similar problem to Sarah, his mother.
        Genesis 25:21, NLT: Isaac pleaded with the LORD on behalf of his wife, because she was unable to have children. The LORD answered Isaac's prayer, and Rebecca became pregnant with twins.
        They had Esau and Jacob. Jacob received the blessing and was to carry on the lineage.  God renamed him Israel. His wife Rachael was also barren and after many years God allowed her to conceive, and she bore Joseph and Benjamin.  But it was not until Leah, the "unloved" wife, had birthed their fourth son, Judah , and no, this is not a mistake. (Her story is in Genesis 29).
        From him, through Leah, would come the Tribe of Judah from which the SEED of the Messiah would come. Jesus was from the Tribe of Judah. So, God chose Leah, this time, to carry the SEED, and Rachel failed to conceive until after Judah was born, then the womb was opened, and she conceived Joseph and Benjamin. All twelve of their children became the twelve tribes of Israel.
        That's three times already that God revealed how wanted to bring the seed through a specific woman to bear the SEED that would lead to the Messiah.  I'm sure there are many more accounts of how the SEED passed through unlikely women.  But the biggest one is next.
        MARY:  Mary's was the most miraculous of them all, since she had never been with a man. (Matthew 1:18-25) But she was to deliver the Messiah, the seed of a woman, who would bruise the serpent's head, a promise now being fulfilled from way back in the Garden of Eden. (again Genesis 3:15)     


      </p>
      <p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day  6 Exodus/Passover</strong><br><br>
        Exodus 11:4-9 The tenth and final plague that would cause Pharoah to finally give in and release the Hebrew slaves from 400 years of bondage would be more terrifying than any of the others. The death angel was coming for the first born of every family, unless they did as God instructed.  They had to follow God's protocol to the letter.  They were to sacrifice a perfect lamb and put its blood on the sides and tops of door frames of their dwellings, and for those who followed God's protocol, the death angel would pass over and they would be saved from the plague. Once freed from slavery, this became a yearly event to remind themselves of how by following God's instructions, they were spared from death, and were freed from 400 years of bondage.
        This yearly remembrance  would be memorialized as one of the seven Feasts called Passover, because Yahweh/God  passed over those who had the blood on their doorposts.  
        So many things about the Passover Lamb foreshadow the coming Messiah.  It had to be a male first born without blemish. No bone could be broken.  And the temple lamb had to be publicly tied to the altar before being sacrificed.  There are so many parallels if one just takes the time to look.  I will be covering much of those later.
        God also had a protocol for how we would be saved from eternal death, by giving his firstborn, Jesus, to become "the Passover Lamb" for us. He qualified in every way to be the final Passover Lamb. He was called the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world for a reason.  The blood of THIS LAMB causes the certainty of "spiritual death" and God's judgment to pass over us.

      </p>
      <p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 7 Leviticus</strong><br><br>
        In Leviticus chapters 1-7, God instructs Moses on how the sacrificial system is to be run with priests and the tabernacle.  I've heard that's a fantastic study in itself!  It would be worth looking into how Jesus is symbolized in the tabernacle.  That is too extensive to be included in this study, but Jesus IS our SACRIFICE, HIGH PRIEST, and TABERNACLE of a better kind.
        Hebrews 9:11-14  But when Christ came as high priest of the good things that are now already here, he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that is not made with human hands, that is to say, is not a part of this creation. 12 He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves; but he entered the Most Holy Place once for all by his own blood, thus obtaining eternal redemption. 13 The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ceremonially unclean sanctify them so that they are outwardly clean. 14 How much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death so that we may serve the living God!
        Instructions for The Feasts of the Lord are written In Leviticus 23, 1) The Lord said to Moses, 2 “Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘These are my appointed festivals, the appointed festivals of the Lord, which you are to proclaim as sacred assemblies.
        This chapter covers the feasts and festivals:  The Sabbath,The Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread, Offering the Firstfruits, The Festival of Weeks/Pentecost, Feasts of Trumpets, The Day of Atonement, The Festival of Tabernacles or Booths.
        In the hebrew language,  the word FEASTS is pronounced "moedim" and means an appointment (a fixed time or season), an appointed time, an assembly (of a congregation), a place of meeting, a signal (as appointed beforehand) and convocations:  In hebrew the word is pronounced "mikra" means a rehearsal - an assembly, calling, reading.
        "If you place these definitions in the context of these verses Leviticus 23:1-2 it would sound like this:  "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, "Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them:  The appointed (beforehand) times and seasons of the LORD, which you shall proclaim to be holy public meetings and rehearsals, these are my appointed (beforehand) times and seasons.
        "One of the most exciting revelations of the Bible is that the Feasts of the Lord are rehearsals for the Messiah's coming to earth.  The traditions and rituals within each of the Feasts are symbolic of specific events which would occur during the Messiah's advents to earth...As we compare the traditions of the Spring Feast to actual events that happened at the end of Jesus' ministry on earth, we see that He perfectly fulfilled the rehearsals in the Spring Feasts to the very day and hour as they occur on the ancient biblical/Jewish calendar."  (quote by Voice of Judah)  
        According to many resources, the Spring Feasts have already been fulfilled in Jesus.  He died at the exact time the temple passover lamb was being sacrificed.  He removed  sin during Unleavened Bread where it is every Jewish person's job was to remove all leaven from their home.  This ceremony is to symbolically remove all sin from the home.  And Jesus resurrected on First Fruits.  
        Pentecost was also fulfilled.  Fifty days after the passover in Egypt, Moses, on Mount Sinai, was given the Law.  
        Fifty days after Jesus became the Passover Lamb, The Holy Spirit was given.  
        The four Fall Feast rehearsals are still waiting to be fulfilled!
      </p>
      <p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 8 Numbers</strong><br><br>
        Numbers is a record of the 40 years in the desert along with all the drama!  The people had spoken badly about God's leader Moses so many times.  Every time they got into big trouble with God, Moses prayed for them.  But their sins against God and Moses did not go without very hard consequences. 
        The wrath of God had come to a head when they just would not stop insulting God and Moses.  He had been tested enough.  Even though God had provided  sandals that miraculously never wore out, manna from heaven, quail, clean water where there was none, "they spoke against God and against Moses, and said, "Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness?  There is no bread:  There is no water? And we detest this miserable food"! (referring to the Mana)
        God had heard enough! 
        Numbers 21:6-9 "Then the Lord sent venomous snakes among them; they bit the people and many Israelites died. The people came to Moses and said, “We sinned when we spoke against the Lord and against you. Pray that the Lord will take the snakes away from us.” So, Moses prayed for the people. The Lord said to Moses, “Make a snake and put it up on a pole; anyone who is bitten can look at it and live.” So Moses made a bronze snake and put it up on a pole. Then when anyone was bitten by a snake and looked at the bronze snake, they lived.
        Not sure I understand the back story on this, but Jesus referred to himself as the Manna from heaven and referred to this incident as well.
        John 6:3-33 Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written: ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’” Jesus said to them, “Very truly I tell you, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is the bread that comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.” ...(vs. 41) At this the Jews there began to grumble about him because he said, "I am the bread that came down from heaven...(vs. 43) "Stop grumbling among yourselves," Jesus answered."
        In an earlier spot, Jesus said, "For my Father’s will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day.” (vs. 40)
        John 3:14-15 Jesus referred to Moses again, "Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him."

      </p>
      <p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 9 Deuteronomy Test</strong><br><br>
        "Deuteronomy is a single long discourse by Moses. In the gospel of Matthew, the temptations are followed by the Sermon on the Mount, a single long discourse by Jesus, in which he explains the deepest meanings and applications of the law."  (goodquestionblog.com)
        According to an article by Mark D. Futato's:  The Gospel in Deuteronomy,  "Jesus quoted the book of Deuteronomy in his own life more than any other book in the Old Testament."
        Right before The Temptation came the Baptism. When Jesus told John the baptizer to go ahead and baptize him, John was reluctant saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?" (Matthew 3:14)  That makes sense because Jesus did not need to repent of anything.  (Hebrews 4:15)   For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet he did not sin."  He passed every test that he went through. But in Matthew 3:15, concerning whether or not he should be baptized, Jesus replied, "Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness."

 
      </p>
      <p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 10:  The Prophets: Part one</strong><br><br>
        We have looked at examples of how Jesus is seen in the Law of Moses, the First five books of the Bible, or Pentateuch.  Jesus said we would also find him in the Prophets.
        Isaiah 9:1,6,7...but in the future he will honor Galilee of the nations, by the Way of the Sea, beyond the Jordan. (remember the Jordan River?)  The people walking in darkness have seen a great light...vs. 6 - For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.  Of the greatness of his government and peace there will be no end.  He will reign of David's throne and over his kingdom, establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness from that time on and forever.  The zeal of the Lord Almighty will accomplish this."
        When Jesus' family was called out of Egypt and directed to Galilee where Jesus would grow up, he did at least 37 recorded specific miracles there.  Though we are aware that he healed hundreds if not thousands when groups came to him.  He grew up in Nazareth of Galilee, but was born in Bethlehem according to prophecy.  Galilee was a huge part of his ministry.
        Isaiah 11:1-2 “ A shoot will come up from the stump of Jesse; from his roots a Branch will bear fruit. The Spirit of the Lord will rest on him— the Spirit of wisdom and of understanding, the Spirit of counsel and of might, the Spirit of the knowledge and fear of the Lord -"
        Romans 15:12 "And again, Isaiah says, "The Root of Jesse will spring up, one who will arise to rule over the nations; in him the Gentiles will hope."
        Revelation 22:16 "I am the Root and Offspring of David, and the bright Morning Star"
        Jesus life is also foreshadowed in Jeremiah 31:15 and Matthew 2:16-28,  Hosea 11:1 and Matthew 2:14-15, Zechariah 9:9 and Mark 11:7-11, and MIcah 5:2 and Luke 2:4-6, but these will be explained later in the study.
      </p> 

      <p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 11- The Prophets:  Part Two Isaiah 53: 1-6</strong><br><br>
        This can be read as is or one can take the time to look up the verses I have included.
        1) Who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?
        2) He grew up before him like a tender shoot, and like a root out of dry ground.  (Isaiah 11:1 )
        He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire.
        3) He was despised and rejected by mankind, a man of suffering, and familiar with pain.  (Acts 26:22-23) Like one from whom people hide their faces, he was despised, and we held him in low esteem.
        4) Surely he took up our pain and bore our suffering, yet we considered him punished by God, stricken by him, and afflicted.  
        5) But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed. (Psalm 103:3)
        6) We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to our own way; and the Lord has laid on him

        7)  He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth; he was led like a lamb to the slaughter,  and as a sheep before its shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth. (Matthew 27:14)
        8)  By oppression and judgment he was taken away. Yet who of his generation protested? For he was cut off from the land of the living; for the transgression of my people he was punished. (1 Peter 3:18)
        9)  He was assigned a grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death, though he had done no violence,     nor was any deceit in his mouth. (John 19:38-40)
        10) Yet it was the Lord’s will to crush him and cause him to suffer, and though the Lord makes his life an offering for sin, he will see his offspring and prolong his days, and the will of the Lord will prosper in his hand. (Hebrews 12:2)
        11)  After he has suffered, he will see the light of life and be satisfied; by his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many, and he will bear their iniquities. (1 Peter 2:24)
        12)  Therefore I will give him a portion among the great, and he will divide the spoils with the strong, because he poured out his life unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors. For he bore the sin of many,     and made intercession for the transgressors. (Luke 23:34)

      <p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 13 The Scepter</strong><br><br>
        Jesus first came as a suffering servant as prophesied, but he is also King and we must never forget that.  He carries a Scepter.
        Scepter:  a full-length staff that symbolizes a ruler's absolute power and authority over a tribe or nation.  It is sometimes translated as club or rod, both of which can be used as weapons.
        Numbers 24:17,19 "I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near.  A star will come out of Jacob; a scepter will rise out of Israel...a ruler will come out of Jacob..."
        The Line of Judah would become the royal line, starting with David all the way to Zedekiah, the last earthly king of Judah.  Jacob's prophecy came true:  the tribe of Judah possessed the scepter. The kings of the Davidic dynasty were all descended from Jacob's/ Israel's fourth son, Judah.  But, 2 Samuel 7:3-16 also indicates that this throne will be eternal.  Some more literal translations, such as the KJV and the NASB, render the prophecy as "until Shiloh comes" - Shiloh being the title of the Messiah.
        In Jacob's/Israel's blessing of his twelve sons, he says about Judah in Genesis 49:10, "The scepter will not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, until he to whom it belongs shall come and the obedience of the nations shall be his."
        Hebrews 1:8-9 "But about the Son he says, 'Your throne, O God, will last forever and ever; a scepter of justice will be the scepter of your kingdom. You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy. (also in Psalm 45:6-7)
        In Revelation 19:15 we see the eternal King coming back:  "Coming out of his mouth is a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations. "He will rule them with an iron scepter."
        Roman soldiers made fun of the idea that Jesus was a king by placing a crown of thorns on His head and a weak reed or fake staff to represent a royal scepter with which they struck him repeatedly. I would not want to be them when he returns with the real scepter at the second coming!
        And they will see him. Revelation 1:7 - "Look, he is coming with the clouds," and "every eye will see him, even those who pierced him"; and all peoples of the earth "will mourn because of him."
        Psalm 2:1-12
        Why do the nations conspire and the peoples plot in vain?  The kings of the earth rise up and the rulers band together against the Lord and against his anointed, saying,  “Let us break their chains and throw off their shackles.” The One enthroned in heaven laughs;  the Lord scoffs at them. He rebukes them in his anger and terrifies them in his wrath, saying, “I have installed my king on Zion, my holy mountain.” I will proclaim the Lord’s decree: He said to me, “You are my son; today I have become your father. Ask me, and I will make the nations your inheritance, the ends of the earth your possession. You will break them with a rod of iron; you will dash them to pieces like pottery.” Therefore, you kings, be wise; be warned, you rulers of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear and celebrate his rule with trembling. Kiss his son, or he will be angry and your way will lead to your destruction, for his wrath can flare up in a moment.  Blessed are all who take refuge in him.

      <p class = "devo"><strong>Emmaus Road Project:  Day 14  Psalm 22</strong><br><br>
        In Matthew 27:46 Jesus cried out something while suffering. Was he only calling out to God in desperation or could there have been more to it?
        At that time, God's word had not been separated into chapters and verses. When someone wanted to bring up a scripture, they would quote the first part of it, and the listener would know which one they were talking about.
        Psalm 22: 1-18
        1) My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from saving me, so far from my cries of anguish?
        2 My God, I cry out by day, but you do not answer, by night, but I find no rest.
        3 Yet you are enthroned as the Holy One; you are the one Israel praises. 
        4 In you our ancestors put their trust; they trusted and you delivered them.
        5 To you they cried out and were saved; in you they trusted and were not put to shame.
        6 But I am a worm and not a man, scorned by everyone, despised by the people.
        7 All who see me mock me; they hurl insults, shaking their heads.
        8 “He trusts in the Lord,” they say, “let the Lord rescue him. Let him deliver him, since he delights in him.”
        9 Yet you brought me out of the womb; you made me trust in you, even at my mother’s breast.
        10 From birth I was cast on you; from my mother’s womb you have been my God.
        11 Do not be far from me, for trouble is near and there is no one to help.
        12 Many bulls surround me; strong bulls of Bashan encircle me.
        13 Roaring lions that tear their prey open their mouths wide against me.
        14 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint. My heart has turned to wax; it has melted within me.
        15 My mouth[d] is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth; you lay me in the dust of death.
        16 Dogs surround me, a pack of villains encircles me; they pierce my hands and my feet.
        17 All my bones are on display; people stare and gloat over me.
        18 They divide my clothes among them and cast lots for my garment.
        So, could it be he was leading the people to reference the ancient Scriptures in which he is found?  In the middle of all of this he yells out Psalm 22.

        The lineage of Abraham includes many names we are familiar with , like Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah, David with references to "the star of Jacob, the Root of Jesse,  and the branch of David.  All are descriptive of the Messiah coming out of the family line, Genealogy, or family tree:
        Take a minute to look through these lists. Do you recognize names in either or both that you'd not thought about before?  
        List One:  Matthew 1:1-16 Starting with Abraham and leading up to the Messiah.  
        God said in Genesis 12:3 "I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse, and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you."  
        This is already being fulfilled and will continue to grow. Revelation 7:9 reads,  "After this I looked, and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands."
        Referring to the genealogy in Matthew, verse 17 reads, " Thus there were fourteen generations in all from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen from the exile to the Messiah.
        List Two:  Luke 3:23-38 is the genealogy of Jesus through the head of his house, Joseph, starting where they were and going backwards to Adam.  
        Jesus was regularly referred to as "The Son of David" and "The Son of God.  He was also referred to as "Son of Man."  Can you think of more names he went by?  If you're curious enough to look them up you may just discover why he had those titles and what they meant to him!

      <p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 16 Prophecies Beyond Jesus' Control</strong><br><br>
        "Born, bo-orn in, Born in Bethlehem!  the old song goes. (Go where I send Thee...How shall I send thee)
        Anyway, We as  embryos have no say in where we are born.  While in the womb, we just go where mama takes us for 9 months!
        Long ago, the birthplace of the coming Messiah was predicted in Micah 5:2
        “But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah,  though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old,  from ancient times.”
        Mary and Joseph lived in Nazareth. The only reason they went to Bethlehem was because Joseph was in the lineage of King David and needed to register in his hometown at that time.  Why else would they travel at such an inconvenient time?   Hence, the baby Jesus came forth from the womb of Mary in the place where this "ruler over Israel whose origins are from old, from ancient times' was to be born.  (Oh, I've heard this before.  Oh yeah.  In the Scripture above Micah 5:2)
        Some interesting people and events were associated with this area:
        In the Old Testament, Bethlehem was an early Canaanite settlement connected with the patriarchs.  Jacob's favorite wife, Rachel, was buried in this area.  (Genesis 35:19)  
        It was here in young David's hometown that the prophet Samuel anointed him to be king over Israel (1 Samuel 16:1-13).
        The poignant story of Naomi, Ruth, and Boaz from the book of Ruth is set primarily around the town of Bethlehem. King David, the great-grandson of Ruth and Boaz was born and raised in Bethlehem, and there David's mighty men lived. Bethlehem eventually came to be called the City of David as the symbol of his great dynasty. It grew into an important, strategic, and fortified city under King Rehoboam. (Historic Info from an article by Mary Fairchild, updated on September 14, 2020)  
        Now, it makes sense why Jesus was sometimes referred to as the Son of David.
        Also, Bethlehem means "House of Bread"  The bun in the oven "was actually the Bread of Life" born in the "House of Bread!"
        Many of the prophecies about the first and second coming of The Messiah were completely out of Jesus' control.  His lineage, his birthplace, where he would grow up, how people would treat him.  He also made predictions about himself that came true that were beyond his control.  Many of those will be pointed out in the next few studies.

	  <p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day  17 Galilee</strong><br><br>
After Jesus' family was warned in a dream to flee to Egypt to escape Herod's wrath, they were directed by God to move to Galilee.
This had been prophesied long ago in Isaiah 9:1,6,7...but in the future he will honor Galilee of the nations, by the Way of the Sea, beyond Jordan. (remember the Jordan River?)  The people walking in darkness have seen a great light...vs. 6 - For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders.  And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.  Of the greatness of his government and peace there will be no end.  He will reign of David's throne and over his kingdom, establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness from that time on and forever.  The zeal of the Lord Almighty will accomplish this."
So the family was called out of Egypt and directed to Galilee where Jesus did at least 37 recorded miracles.  
I won't attempt to cover all of what happened in Jesus' life, but there were many wonderful and amazing friendships, followers, laughs, learning, ministry, travel, miracles, wisdom, etc.  Jesus went off by himself to pray often as well. </p>
	  <p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 18 Forerunner</strong><br><br>
The Messiah's forerunner came through another woman who was past the age of conceiving. The husband who would be the father of this forerunner was a high priest and did not believe the angel's promise so was struck mute until his son was born.  His voice came back when he blurted out, "His name is John.' the name the angel gave him regarding his son who would prepare the way for the Messiah.
Luke 1:41-45  When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. In a loud voice she exclaimed: “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear! But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. Blessed is she who has believed that the Lord would fulfill his promises to her!”
John 1:14-15 The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth. John testified concerning him. He cried out, saying, “This is the one I spoke about when I said, ‘He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.’”Why would the forerunner John say this? He was physically born before Jesus. It looks as though he may have understood Christ's deity.
Luke 3:2-6 During the high-priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the wilderness. He went into all the country around Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet: “A voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him. Every valley shall be filled in, every mountain and hill made low. The crooked roads shall become straight, the rough ways smooth. And all people will see God’s salvation.’” (That was from Isaiah 40:3) </p> 

	  <p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 19 Parables</strong><br><br>


Matthew 13:34-35
Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables; he did not say anything to them without using a parable. So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet:
“I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world.”
Psalms 78 and Matthew 13:35 speaking in parables
Psalm 78:2 uses the word parable (masal). It means comparison, i.e., a saying which uses one realm of life to illuminate another." (Kinder) ee. Mathew 13:35 quotes Psalm 78:2 as a prophecy of the way Jesus would teach. (Psalm 78:2 - I will open my mouth with a parable; I will utter hidden things, things from of old—) 
Asaph, the poet, singer, prophet in Solomon's era went on to say something that could also apply to us today, so let's look at Psalm 78:1-8: "My people, hear my teaching; listen to the words of my mouth. I will open my mouth with a parable; I will utter hidden things, things from of old— things we have heard and known, things our ancestors have told us. We will not hide them from their descendants; we will tell the next generation the praiseworthy deeds of the LORD, his power, and the wonders he has done. He decreed statutes for Jacob and established the law in Israel, which he commanded our ancestors to teach their children, so the next generation would know them, even the children yet to be born, and they in turn would tell their children. Then they would put their trust in God and would not forget his deeds but would keep his commands. They would not be like their ancestors— a stubborn and rebellious generation, whose hearts were not loyal to God, whose spirits were not faithful to him."

	  <p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 20 Jesus reads the scroll about himself</strong><br><br>
Luke 4:14-21"Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about him spread through the whole countryside. He was teaching in their synagogues, and everyone praised him. He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom. He stood up to read, and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written: “The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.”  
Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him. He began by saying to them, “Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.”
His reading was from Isaiah 61:1 </p>
	  <p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 21 Baptism</strong><br><br>
        (Many say the word "baptize" is not in the Old Testament, therefore it's a thing Jesus instated.  Where in a way, this act was an example for his believers to follow, it wasn't a new thing.  According to the jewishencyclopedia.com and Kaufmann Kohler & Samuel Krauss, Baptism was "A religious ablution signifying purification or consecration. The natural method of cleansing the body by washing and bathing in water was always customary in Israel (see Ablution, Bathing). The washing of their clothes was an important means of sanctification enjoined on the Israelites before the Revelation on Mt. Sinai (Ex. xix. 10). The Rabbis connect with this the duty of bathing by complete immersion ("ṭebilah," Yeb. 46b; Mek., Baḥodesh, iii.); and since sprinkling with blood was always accompanied by immersion, tradition connects with this immersion the blood lustration mentioned as having also taken place immediately before the Revelation (Ex. xxiv. 8), these three acts being the initiatory rites always performed upon proselytes, "to bring them under the wings of the Shekinah" (Yeb. l.c.)." 
        So much happened at  Jesus' baptism. (Matthew 3)  He was immersed, had at least three witnesses confirming he is God's Son:  John, the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him, and a voice from heaven that said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
        After this confirmation, came Matthew 4:1 "Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. After fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry."
        In every case, Jesus quoted from the Book of Deuteronomy in context in order to resist the devil, and Jesus passed the test. Deuteronomy 8:3"...man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord."  Deuteronomy 6:13 - "Fear the Lord your God, serve him only..."(vs.6) “Do not put the Lord your God to the test..."  Luke 4:4...Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone.’... (vs. 8) “It is written: ‘Worship the Lord your God and serve him only...(vs. 12) Jesus answered, “It is said: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test."   
        Jesus passed the test and "From that time on Jesus began to preach, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near." (Matthew 4:17)
        In Matthew 5:17, Jesus said, “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.

	  <p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day  23 Claims to Be equal with God</strong><br><br>
God called himself, I AM in Exodus 3:14..  Jesus when addressing the Jewish leaders in John 8:56-59, "our father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was glad.”  "You are not yet fifty years old,” they said to him, “and you have seen Abraham!”  “Very truly I tell you,” Jesus answered, “before Abraham was born, I am!”  At this, they picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus hid himself, slipping away from the temple grounds.
He also said, in John 10:30-31, "I and the Father are one."  The Jews took up stones again to stone Him.
They did this because they were assuming he was committing blasphemy, claiming equality with God.  But if he was God then it was NOT blasphemy.  Those who say Jesus did not claim to be God do not understand that this is the main reason the Jewish leaders had him crucified.  They did not believe he was who He said.
His disciples and many others did believe.  John 1:1-5 clearly testifies this in speaking of Jesus, The Word:  " In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind.  The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it." This teaching continues through the first chapter of John.
 </p>
	  <p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 24 Palms & Fists</strong><br><br>
Jesus told the disciples ahead of time what would happen to him but it didn't sink in.  He continued to gain great popularity and before long crowds were waving palm branches and making a path for "Hosana" as he rode a donkey down the path fulfilling the prophecy from Zechariah 9:9, ".Rejoice greatly, Daughter Zion! Shout, Daughter Jerusalem! See, your king comes to you, righteous and victorious, lowly and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey."
Six days later in Matthew 27:22-25:  "What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called the Messiah?” Pilate asked. They all answered, “Crucify him!” “Why? What crime has he committed?” asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, “Crucify him!” When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. “I am innocent of this man’s blood,” he said. “It is your responsibility!” All the people answered, “His blood is on us and on our children!”
At Penticost Peter addressed  them (Acts 2:36-39)  “Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah.” When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, “Brothers, what shall we do?”Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off—for all whom the Lord our God will call.” </p>
	  <p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 25- Premeditated Betrayal</strong><br><br>
Matthew 26:14-15  "Then one of the Twelve—the one called Judas Iscariot—went to the chief priests and asked, “What are you willing to give me if I deliver him over to you?” So they counted out thirty pieces of silver.
Matthew 27:3-10  "When Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders. “I have sinned,” he said, “for I have betrayed innocent blood.” “What is that to us?” they replied. “That’s your responsibility.” So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself. The chief priests picked up the coins and said, “It is against the law to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money.” So they decided to use the money to buy the potter’s field as a burial place for foreigners. That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day. Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled:
“They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price set on him by the people of Israel, and they used them to buy the potter’s field, as the Lord commanded me.” (referring to Jeremiah 19:1-13)
Zechariah 11:13 "And the Lord said to me, “Throw it to the potter”—the handsome price at which they valued me! So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them to the potter at the house of the Lord.
Judas would also break bread at the Last Supper with Jesus and His disciples and fulfill Psalm 41:9 - "Even my close friend, someone I trusted, one who shared my bread,has turned against me." </p>
<p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 26- Covenant, Arrest, Betrayal, Trial, Beating</strong><br><br>

On the evening of what we call The Last Supper:  Matthew 26:26-28  "While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, “Take and eat; this is my body.”Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you.  This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
Right before that he had revealed that someone would betray him, and that's when Judas stepped out of the room.  After a sweet time of communion, Jesus turned toward the disciples and in Matthew 26:31-35 "Then Jesus told them, “This very night you will all fall away on account of me, for it is written: "I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’ (from Zechariah 13:7) But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.”Peter replied, “Even if all fall away on account of you, I never will.” 'Truly I tell you,” Jesus answered, “this very night, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.”  
After this very special time, Jesus took his disciples to a garden to pray.  This is recorded in Matthew 26:36-46.  He wanted so much for his disciples to pray with him but he had to do this alone.  That's why he went a little distance from them.  Each time he went back to check on them they had drifted off to sleep.
So after an intense and lonely  inner battle involving sweating something like drops of blood and asking God to take away this cup from him but not his will but God's be done, he was identified by Judas and a whole group of soldiers came to take him to a sketchy trial.
And just as Zechariah 13:7 prophesied, the disciples scattered.  And just as Jesus had predicted, Peter would deny three times, hear the cock crow, and weep bitterly.

<p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 27 The Sanhedrin Trial</strong><br><br>

Matthew 57-68
Jesus Before the Sanhedrin:   Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled. But Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome.  The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death. But they did not find any, though many false witnesses came forward.  Finally two came forward and declared, “This fellow said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.’”
This fulfilled the prophecy from Psalm 27:12 "Do not turn me over to the desire of my foes, for false witnesses rise up against me, spouting malicious accusations."
Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, “Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?” But Jesus remained silent. This fulfilled Isaiah 53:7, "He was oppressed and afflicted; yet He opened not his mouth.  He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter; and as a sheep before it's shearers is dumb (silent), so he opened not his mouth."
(This is also written about in Mark 15:3, "And the chief priests were vehemently accusing Him of many things; but He answered nothing.")
Finally he spoke up when the high priest said to him, “I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God.” “You have said so,” Jesus replied. “But I say to all of you: From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."  Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, “He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy. 66 What do you think?” “He is worthy of death,” they answered.  Then they spit in his face and struck him with their fists. Others slapped him 68 and said, “Prophesy to us, Messiah. Who hit you?”

<p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 28 Innocent Blood Before Pilate</strong><br><br>

Matthew 27:1-2 "  Early in the morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people made their plans how to have Jesus executed. 2 So they bound him, led him away and handed him over to Pilate the governor.
Judas returned to the chief priest and the elders, in Matthew 27:4 - "I have sinned," he said, "for I have betrayed innocent blood."  But it made no difference.  Everything was set in motion.  
Jesus had already been sent to Pilate, the governor, who had questioned him face to face, and found no fault in him. (Luke 23:4)
While Pilate was sitting on the judge’s seat, his wife sent him this message: “Don’t have anything to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him.” (Matthew 27:19)
20 But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus executed.  21 “Which of the two do you want me to release to you?” asked the governor.  “Barabbas,” they answered. 22 “What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called the Messiah?” Pilate asked.  They all answered, “Crucify him!”  23 “Why? What crime has he committed?” asked Pilate.  But they shouted all the louder, “Crucify him!”
24 When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. “I am innocent of this man’s blood,” he said. “It is your responsibility!”
25 All the people answered, “His blood is on us and on our children!”
26 Then he released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.
Little did they know that they also prophesied about their own potential future.  They took responsibility for crucifying him, but at Pentecost, some would be pierced to the heart and could only pray that the cleansing blood of Jesus would be upon themselves and their children.
When Peter revealed how Jesus was God's chosen Messiah in Acts 2:37, the response was, 37 When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, “Brothers, what shall we do?”  38 Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 39 The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off—for all whom the Lord our God will call.”

Matthew 27 starting at verse 27
The Soldiers Mocked Jesus as predicted in Isaiah 50:6 but in the end, God will not be mocked.  He will bring about the glory that is promised to Jesus.
*Matthew 27:27 "Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium (Palace) and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him."   All eyes staring at him.
(But in Revelation 1:7 it is prophesied that every eye will also be on him but in awe of his majestic reappearance!"  (He had also recently prophesied this when the high priest said to him, "I charge you under oath by the living God:  Tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God."  "You have said so,” Jesus replied. “But I say to all of you: From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.")
*Matthew 27:28a "They stripped him ..."
Psalm 22:17 "All my bones were on display; people stare and gloat over me."
(But in Hebrews 12:2b, "...For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning it's shame and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.")
Matthew 27:28b " ...and put a scarlet robe on him."
(Exodus:  26:31-33The curtain ordered to be in these colors was to hang from the clasps and the ark of the covenant in the tabernacle was to be placed behind it.  It would separate the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place.  (Exodus 26:31 "And thou shalt make a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen of cunning work:  with cherubims shall it be made:) - info rom christianitystackexchange.com
(But in Revelation 19:13 he is described as wearing a robe dipped in blood..." Revelation 19:16, "On his robe and on his thigh he has this name written:  KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS")
*Matthew 27:29a  "and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head..."
(But in Revelation 19:12a He is described this way:  "His eyes are like a blazing fire, and on his head were many crowns...")
Matthew 27:29b "...They put a staff in his right hand.
(But Hebrews 1:8 reads, "But about the Son he says, 'Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever; a scepter of justice will be the scepter of your kingdom.")
Matthew 27:29c  "...Then they knelt in front of him..."  
(But in Roman 14:11 - "It is written 'As surely as I live says the Lord, 'every knee will bow before me;"
Matthew 27:29d  "...and mocked him. “Hail, king of the Jews!” they said."
(But Romans 2:10-11 prophecies, "that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue acknowledges that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of the Father.)
*Matthew 27:30a  They spit on him, (Isaiah 50:6b - "...I did not cover My face from humiliation and spitting")
Sad, because  the only time we saw Jesus spitting was when he spit into the dirt and made a paste to put on a blind man's eye to give him his sight and to heal others sometimes in this way -John 9:6-7, Mark 7:33, Mark 8:23)
 Matthew 27:30b and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again
But Revelation 19:15 - Coming out of his mouth is a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations. “He will rule them with an iron scepter.” He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty.
Matthew 27:31 After they had mocked him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to crucify him.
Isaiah 50:6a "I gave my back to those who strike Me..."
significance:  John 10:18- "No one takes it (my life) from me, but I lay it down of my own accord.  I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again.  This command I received from my Father."  
So when it says he gave his back, that's exactly what he did:  He gave it.

<p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 30 Sign Garment Mockery Prophecies</strong><br><br>
﻿
John 19:19-22- "Pilate had a notice prepared and fastened to the cross. It read: Jesus of Nazareth, the king of the jews. 20 Many of the Jews read this sign, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the sign was written in Aramaic, Latin and Greek. 21 The chief priests of the Jews protested to Pilate, “Do not write ‘The King of the Jews,’ but that this man claimed to be king of the Jews.”  22 Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.”
(This is a prophetic foreshadowing of Jesus' return as King of Kings to all people whether they like it or not!)
23 When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes, dividing them into four shares, one for each of them, with the undergarment remaining. This garment was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom.  24 “Let’s not tear it,” they said to one another. “Let’s decide by lot who will get it.” This happened so that the scripture might be fulfilled that said, "They divided my clothes among them and cast lots for my garment.” So this is what the soldiers did"  (This was a fulfillment of Psalm 22:18 that says exactly that!)
He continued to be mocked by the people. Matthew 27:40 and saying, “You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!” 41 In the same way the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him. 42 “He saved others,” they said, “but he can’t save himself! He’s the king of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. 43 He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he wants him, for he said, ‘I am the Son of God.’” 44 In the same way the rebels who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him.  (This is the fulfillment of Psalm 22:7-8 - "7 All who see me mock me; they hurl insults, shaking their heads.  8 “He trusts in the Lord,” they say, “let the Lord rescue him.  Let the Lorddeliver him, since he delights in him.”)
God does delight in his son and Jesus knew it.  In John 10:17-18 Jesus had said, "The reason my Father loves me is that I lay down my life—only to take it up again. No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again. This command I received from my Father.”
And by the time they had come to arrest him he said, "Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels? But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way?” (Matthew 26:53-54)
 </p>
<p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 31 Intercession for Transgressors</strong><br><br>

Isaiah 53:12 prophesied, "Therefore I will give him a portion among the great, and he will divide the spoils with the strong, because he poured out his life unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors.  For he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors."
Luke 23:32-34"Two other men, both criminals, were also led out with him to be executed. When they came to the place called the Skull, they crucified him there, along with the criminals—one on his right, the other on his left. Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing...”
Mark 15:27-32  They crucified two rebels with him, one on his right and one on his left. Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, “So! You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, come down from the cross and save yourself!” In the same way the chief priests and the teachers of the law mocked him among themselves. “He saved others,” they said, “but he can’t save himself! Let this Messiah, this king of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe.” Those crucified with him also heaped insults on him.
As we saw yesterday Jesus could have backed out but he would follow through no matter what.  So while on the cross, even while suffering for the sins of the world, he was in his priestly mode, because he was not only the King of Kings in reality, but also the Great High Priest of the Kingdom.  So we see him making intercession for the people even here.
As we read above, those crucified with him also heaped insults on him.  Luke 23:39-41 "One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him: “Aren’t you the Messiah? Save yourself and us!”But the other criminal rebuked him. “Don’t you fear God,” he said, “since you are under the same sentence? We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong.”Then he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.  Jesus answered him, “Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise.”

<p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 33 Psalm 22 Vinegar No Broken Bones</strong><br><br>

Matthew 27:45-47  "From noon until three in the afternoon darkness came over all the land. About three in the afternoon Jesus cried out in a loud voice, “Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?” (which means “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”)
Was he referring to Psalm 22?  That is the way they referenced scripture back then, not by chapters and verses.  He could have very well been declaring prophecy fulfilled.
Psalm 69:21 - "They put gall in my food and gave me vinegar for my thirst."  
Fulfilled in John 19:28-30 "Later, knowing that everything had now been finished, and so that Scripture would be fulfilled, Jesus said, “I am thirsty.” A jar of wine vinegar was there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put the sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant, and lifted it to Jesus’ lips. When he had received the drink, Jesus said, “It is finished.” With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.
John 19:3-37 "Now it was the day of Preparation, and the next day was to be a special Sabbath. Because the Jewish leaders did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down. 32 The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and then those of the other. 33 But when they came to Jesus and found that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. 34 Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus’ side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water. 35 The man who saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, and he testifies so that you also may believe. 36 These things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled: “Not one of his bones will be broken,” 37 and, as another scripture says, “They will look on the one they have pierced.”

<p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 34 Sacrifice Accepted and Priesthood</strong><br><br>



"into Your hand I commit My spirit..." Psalm 32:5
Luke 23:46 - "And after crying out with a loud voice, Jesus said, "Father, into Your hands I commit My spirit."
Matthew 27:50 "And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit.  At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom."
In an article by Professor Daniel M. Gurtner about the Torn Veil, he writes, "The veil was near the very center of the tabernacle, suggesting a rank of holiness that is also reflected in the quality of its construction. As with the other hangings in the tabernacle, the veil was made of “finely twisted linen” (Exodus 26:31 NIV), a fine grade of linen." Have you ever even tried to rip a 3 cord strand?  Impossible.  Plus it was hanging, so even an earthquake could not have ripped it from top to bottom!  This had to be supernatural.  What was God trying to say?  Professor Gurtner goes on to explain, "The veil’s primary function was to separate the holy place from the holy of holies (Exodus 26:33). This separation is at the heart of the entire priestly code of the sacrificial system (e.g., Leviticus 11:1–45): to separate (badal) between the unclean and the clean. Likewise, in Ezekiel’s vision of the temple, there is to be separation of “the holy and the profane” (Ezekiel 42:20 NASB; cf. Ezekiel 22:26; 44:23). The veil, then, was a physical barrier that both represented and enforced the separation from the holy presence of the enthroned Yahweh within from Aaron and his sons — the violation of which brought death (Numbers 18:7; cf. Leviticus 16:2).  Exception for entering the holy of holies was made only in the context of the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16:11–28), when the high priest would take the offering behind the veil as a sin or purification offering (Leviticus 16:11). Here the blood was taken into the holy of holies and sprinkled on the atonement slate of the ark (Leviticus 16:14). On the Day of Atonement, Aaron was to use the blood of the sin offering to purify and consecrate the altar (Leviticus 16:19). Yet the man entering must be the high priest and may not enter “whenever he chooses,” says the Lord, “for I will appear in the cloud over the atonement cover” (Leviticus 16:2 NIV; Numbers 7:89)."
In gotquestions.org we read, " What significance does this torn veil have for us today? Above all, the tearing of the veil at the moment of Jesus’ death dramatically symbolized that His sacrifice, the shedding of His own blood, was a sufficient atonement for sins. It signified that now the way into the Holy of Holies was open for all people, for all time, both Jew and Gentile.  When Jesus died, the veil was torn, and God moved out of that place never again to dwell in a temple made with human hands (Acts 17:24). God was through with that temple and its religious system, and the temple and Jerusalem were left “desolate” (destroyed by the Romans) in A.D. 70, just as Jesus prophesied in Luke 13:35. As long as the temple stood, it signified the continuation of the Old Covenant. Hebrews 9:8-9 refers to the age that was passing away as the new covenant was being established (Hebrews 8:13). In a sense, the veil was symbolic of Christ Himself as the only way to the Father (John 14:6). This is indicated by the fact that the high priest had to enter the Holy of Holies through the veil. Now Christ is our superior High Priest, and as believers in His finished work, we partake of His better priesthood. We can now enter the Holy of Holies through Him. Hebrews 10:19-20 says, “We have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain, that is, his body.” Here we see the image of Jesus’ flesh being torn for us just as He was tearing the veil for us. The profound significance of the tearing of the veil is explained in glorious detail in Hebrews. The things of the temple were shadows of things to come, and they all ultimately point us to Jesus Christ. He was the veil to the Holy of Holies, and through His death the faithful now have free access to God.  The veil in the temple was a constant reminder that sin renders humanity unfit for the presence of God. The fact that the sin offering was offered annually and countless other sacrifices repeated daily showed graphically that sin could not truly be atoned for or erased by mere animal sacrifices. Jesus Christ, through His death, has removed the barriers between God and man, and now we may approach Him with confidence and boldness (Hebrews 4:14-16).

<p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 35  Rich Man's Tomb</strong><br><br>

Prophecy:  Isaiah 53:9 - "He made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; although He had done no violence, nor was any deceit in His mouth."
Fulfillment:  Matthew 27:57-60 "As evening approached, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus. Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus’ body, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him. Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away."
We are already aware that before Jesus died, he prophesied what would happen to him.  But he had also told the Pharisees and teacher of the law in Matthew 12:40  "For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth."   This was happening right now.  
But way before this, right after Jesus had "cleansed the temple," and fulfilled the prophecy fro Psalm 69:9, "Zeal for your house will consume me," in John 2:13-17, in verses 18-22 "The Jews then responded to him, “What sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this?” Jesus answered them, “Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days.” They replied, “It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and you are going to raise it in three days?” But the temple he had spoken of was his body. After he was raised from the dead, his disciples recalled what he had said. Then they believed the scripture and the words that Jesus had spoken."  This would be fulfilled very soon.
The chief priests and Pharisees did remember he had prophesied this.  Maybe it was beginning to click that this was not about the temple, but his body.  So they went to Pilate in Matthew 28:63-66 they said, “We remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said, ‘After three days I will rise again.’ So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first.”  “Take a guard,” Pilate answered. “Go, make the tomb as secure as you know how.” 66 So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard.
But all would happen as prophesied, from the Scriptures and from Jesus' own mouth.
Way back in Genesis 12:3 God had promised Abraham,  “I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you; I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse; and all peoples on earth  will be blessed through you.” And God would keep his word that through Jesus, all nations would be blessed.  Below I've included just one example of how he even let some Gentiles in on what was going to happen.
John 12:20-23 "Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the festival. They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. “Sir,” they said, “we would like to see Jesus.”  Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip in turn told Jesus.  Jesus replied, “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. 24 Very truly I tell you, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed."   Maybe it would click with them too after he had risen!

<p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 36 Four Jewish Feasts Fulfilled</strong><br><br>


"One of the most exciting revelations of the Bible is that the Feasts of the Lord are rehearsals for the Messiah's coming to earth.  The traditions and rituals within each of the Feasts are symbolic of specific events which would occur during the Messiah's advents to earth...As we compare the traditions of the Spring Feast to actual events that happened at the end of Jesus' ministry on earth, we see that He perfectly fulfilled the rehearsals in the Spring Feasts to the very day and hour as they occur on the ancient biblical/Jewish calendar."  (quote by Voice of Judah)  Here are some resources for anyone who wants to learn more about these amazing Feasts:  1.DVD-Based Study of Feasts of the Bible, The book, Messianic Passover Haggadah by Sam Nadler, and Unlocking the Mysteries of Revelation Using The Keys of the JFeasts of the Lord by Carlton and Mineer.  1.  Passover:  Most of us are familiar with Passover.  When God sent the final plague to Egypt, the only way anyone could escape death of their firstborn was to sacrifice a perfect male lamb with no broken bones and place its blood on the doorposts of their house.  If they followed God's protocol, they personally would not receive God's judgement. At a later Passover Celebration, Jesus and the temple Lamb would die at the same time:  be sacrificed at the same time.  It's interesting that Jesus is also referred to as the "firstborn" in several scriptures.  2.  Unleavened Bread:  "According to tradition, on the evening of the 13th day, the head of the household must make sure that there is no leaven anywhere in the home.  After the sun sets, he takes a lighted candle and goes about looking into every nook and cranny searching for any scraps of leaven, using a wooden spoon and feather - then this would be disposed of by burning, immersing in water, burying, or scattering into the wind such that no leaven could be seen.  The leaven would be whisked into the spoon and the spoon would be wrapped in linen until it could be properly disposed of..."  Also, a prayer was said after completing the search and removal of Leaven.  To make  sure everything was covered, they prayed, "Any leavened bread or leaven which is in my possession and which I have not seen, not disposed of, nor did I know of it, may it be considered as null and as ownerless like the dust of the earth. 1 Corinthians 5:7 - "Get rid of the old yeast, so that you may be a new unleavened batch -as you really are.  For Christ , our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed...3.  Jesus rose from the dead on the Feast of First Fruits.  Jesus ascended from the dead as prophesied in Psalm 16:10.  "The Feast of first fruits was celebrated on the third day, the 16th of Nisan.  This "third day" celebration was the same day Jesus resurrected from the dead.  In 1 Corinthians 15:20 Paul refers to Jesus as the first fruits of the dead.  Lastly, after Jesus' ascension, came Pentecost.  The time from Jesus' crucifixion at the Passover to Pentecost was 50 days.  Interestingly, the time from the passover in Egypt to the Law given on Mount Sinai was also 50 days.  In one God gave the law.  In the other God gave the Holy Spirit.  These are the Spring Feasts that have been fulfilled.  The completion of the Fall Feasts are still to come.  It is said that the Spring Feasts were about the coming of the Suffering Servant and the Messiah's first advent, and the Fall Feast will reveal the second coming of the Messiah.  I guess we'll see!

<p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 37 A Prophet like Moses</strong><br><br>

God prophesying through Moses in Deuteronomy:  "The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your fellow Israelites.  You must listen to him."
Let's look into some ways in which Moses and Jesus were similar.  These comparisons are called "types."  In this devotional I will use the name Jesus and Yeshua interchangeably.  
1.  Both Hebrew Prophets but accepted by the Gentiles too.  Moses' father in law, a Midianite, instantly believed (Exodus 18:10-11) The Egyptians too came to believe that the God of Israel was real and true.  And the non-Jews readily accepted Yeshua's message of salvation.  2.  Both were forced out of their original birthplaces.  (Exodus 2:15 and Matthew 2:13) to escape a mass infant annihilation and they survived. 3.  Moses and Jesus both spent time in Egypt:  Moses was raised there until a man and had to escape from Egypt. Jesus as a toddler had to escape to Egypt with his family for several years. 4.  Both were rich and became poor. Jesus from heaven, Moses from Egypt. 5.  Both were sent to bring salvation after 400 years of apparent inactivity from God - the Israelites had been enslaved for 400 years in Egypt, and the 400 years before Yeshua came had been notably silent years from God. 6.  Both fasted for 40 days and nights - Moses while on Mount Sinai, and Yeshua in the Judean desert, when being tempted by Satan.  7.  Both were given a public stamp of approval with an audible voice from heaven, heard by the crowd - Moses at Sinai, and Yeshua at his baptism.  8.  Both were called by God to do impossible tasks including signs and wonders, miracles and exits.  9.  Both miraculously provided the people with bread to eat - manna was sent from heaven for the Israelites.   Yeshua famously fed the multitudes twice.  Plus Jesus claimed to be the manna from heaven.  10.  Both instituted a covenant of blood that brought salvation for many - Moses with the Passover lamb's blood on the doorposts.  Yeshua, Lamb of God, brought in the new covenant in his blood on the beams of the cross.  11.  God installed the law through Moses (Exodus 19:1-20:21 and fulfilled it in Christ. (Matthew 5:17-20)  12/  Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness so that all who looked to it would be saved. (Numbers 21:4-9)  Jesus was raised up in the same way and prophesied this.  (John 3:14)  13. Both were shepherds.  Moses literally and figuratively.  Jesus figuratively.  The Great Shepard.  14. Both were originally rejected by the Jews when the foretold salvation didn't seem as if it was going to happen.  When Moses first challenged Pharaoh, things got a lot worse for the Israelites, leading to despair and anger. Yeshua's crucifixion looked like a hopeless defeat.  Both salvation situations initially looked like the promises were not going to come true, but they did.  15.  Moses began the journey of leading God's people to the promised land.  Jesus will complete that task!

In his first coming, Jesus/Yeshua came primarily in the role of a prophet.  After resurrection and ascension, He entered His role as our heavenly High Priest.  When he comes again, He will reign in Zion as King.
Jesus already prayed so much!  He often went away by himself for a night or so to spend time alone with the Father.  (Luke 5:16) He prayed for Jerusalem.  (Matthew 23:37)  He prayed for his disciples specifically as in (Luke 22:32).  He prayed a long prayer before he had to leave them.  (John 17)  He prayed out loud for the sake of those listening.  (John 11:42)  He also heard from His Father.  (John 8:26, 38, 40), and he (John 5:19) watched his Father's every move.  He prayed for his persecutors.  (Luke 23:34) and he continuously makes intercession for us.  (Hebrews 7:25)  My Grandpa used to always say that Jesus was our lawyer.  In gotquestions.org, it says,"Jesus is always pleading our case before the Father, like a defense lawyer on our behalf. Jesus is interceding for us while Satan (whose name means "accuser") is accusing us, pointing out our sins and frailties before God, just as he did with Job (Job 1:6-12).   We already showed how he made the last sacrifice of lambs, bulls, etc.  Now we see more of how he makes intercession for us.  But he is an unusual Priest.  He is a Priest in the order of Melchizedek.  According to https://www.britannica.com, Melchizedik, also spelled Melchisedech, in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament), a figure of importance in Biblical tradition because he was both King and priest, was connected with Jerusalem, and was revered by Abraham, who paid a tithe to him. (Genesis 14:18-20).  According to gotquestions.org "In Psalm 110, a messianic psalm written by David (Matthew 22:43), Melchizedek is presented as a type of Christ. Hebrews 5:1-10 "Every high priest is selected from among the people and is appointed to represent the people in matters related to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and are going astray, since he himself is subject to weakness. This is why he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins, as well as for the sins of the people. And no one takes this honor on himself, but he receives it when called by God, just as Aaron was. In the same way, Christ did not take on himself the glory of becoming a high priest. But God said to him, “You are my Son; today I have become your Father.”And he says in another place, “You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.”During the days of Jesus’ life on earth, he offered up prayers and petitions with fervent cries and tears to the one who could save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission. Son though he was, he learned obedience from what he suffered and, once made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him and was designated by God to be high priest in the order of Melchizedek.

<p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 39 King on David's Throne</strong><br><br>


Isaiah 9:6-7 Isaiah 9:6-7 "For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders.  And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.  Of the greatness of his government and peace there will be no end.  He will reign on David’s throne and over his kingdom, establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness from that time on and forever. The zeal of the Lord Almighty will accomplish this.  2 Samuel 7:16 " Your house and your kingdom will endure forever before me[a]; your throne will be established forever.’” Psalm 45:6-7 Your throne, O God,[a] will last for ever and ever; a scepter of justice will be the scepter of your kingdom. You love righteousness and hate wickedness; therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy."
Jesus claimed to be the king/Messiah. One time, Jesus shared a Psalm that stumped the Pharisees so much that after he brought it up, "No one could say a word in reply, and from that day on no one dared to ask him any more questions."  Matthew 22:46.  So what was the conversation?  Let's go back to vs. 41 "While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, 42 “What do you think about the Messiah? Whose son is he?”  “The son of David,” they replied. 43 He said to them, “How is it then that David, speaking by the Spirit, calls him ‘Lord’? For he says, 44 “‘The Lord said to my Lord: “Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.”’45 If then David calls him ‘Lord,’ how can he be his son?”                                                              This was from Psalm 110.  This Messiah would be heir to David's throne and eternal.  Later at Pentecost in Acts chapter 2:22-   Peter Addresses the Crowd. "Fellow Israelites, listen to this: Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders and signs, which God did among you through him, as you yourselves know. This man was handed over to you by God’s deliberate plan and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men, put him to death by nailing him to the cross. But God raised him from the dead, freeing him from the agony of death, because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him.  David said about him:  “‘I saw the Lord always before me. Because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken. Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will rest in hope, because you will not abandon me to the realm of the dead, you will not let your holy one see decay. You have made known to me the paths of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence.' “Fellow Israelites, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried, and his tomb is here to this day. But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that he would place one of his descendants on his throne. Seeing what was to come, he spoke of the resurrection of the Messiah, that he was not abandoned to the realm of the dead, nor did his body see decay. God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of it. Exalted to the right hand of God, he has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear. For David did not ascend to heaven, and yet he said, "‘The Lord said to my Lord: “Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.”’ (From Psalm 110:1)  “Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah.”  Fast forward to the trial of Stephen, the first one to lose his life for Jesus in Acts 6 & 7.  Right before he was martyred, he "...Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, looked up to heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.  "Look," he said, "I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God."  So where is Jesus now?  Our Prophet, Priest, King is at the right hand of the Father!

<p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 40 Adam verses Jesus</strong><br><br>

The first place we find the foretelling of a coming Messiah in the Scriptures is when God's own creation betrays him.  This was deadly.  In fact, God had clearly warned Adam in Genesis 2:16 "And the Lord God commanded the man, “You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; 17 but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die.” And now, the only one that could fix this was Jesus.
 In this forty day devotional I have attempted to fill in some blanks concerning Jesus' profession on the Emmaus Road that we could find him in the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms if we took the time to look for him there.  I have studied for four months and shared the connections I found between Old Testament Scriptures and and new.  I have shared predictions that Jesus would have never had control over, such as where he was born, where he was raised, how people would treat him and the details of how he would die. I have shared predictions Jesus made about himself that came to pass.  Putting this together has been a sobering and beautiful experience for me.  I truly hope you have enjoyed the journey down the Emmaus Road along with me.  
I like John Stonestree's words, "The whole book is about Jesus. No matter what book of the Bible you’re studying, I can promise it points to Jesus, even Genesis. Paul teaches that Christ is the Last Adam, Who obeyed His Father when Adam failed to, bringing life through His death and resurrection. And there are other amazing marks of Scripture’s symmetry and divine origin. The first Adam yielded to temptation in a garden; the Last Adam conquered temptation in a garden. The first Adam blamed his bride. The Last Adam took the blame for His bride. The first Adam was naked and received clothes. The Last Adam had clothes, but was stripped. The first Adam tasted death from a tree. The Last Adam tasted death on a tree. The first Adam brought thorns. The Last Adam wore thorns. It’s no wonder that when Mary Magdalene saw the risen Christ, she mistook Him for the gardener. Christ is the new and better keeper of God’s garden."
If you have a chance, look up a painting called, Mary Comforts Eve by a Nun named  Sr Grace Remington.  She portrays  what can only be expressed so beautifully in art form. The SEED coming full circle.
