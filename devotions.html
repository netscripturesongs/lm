      <p class = "devoh">40 Days of my Emmaus Road Project</p>
      <p class = "devo">In John 5:39 Jesus is responding to very educated Jewish religious leaders: - "You study the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify about me,"
        The "Scriptures" he referenced above could have only been those read from ancient scrolls since the New Testament had not yet been written.  But after it was written,connections between Jesus and the Scriptures are referred to in many instances.  I hope to share those connections and to fill in some blanks or provide more detail for those not specifically expounded upon.
        With a complete Bible and many resources, we have the opportunity to look these things up for ourselves.  What especially caught my curiosity was when Jesus was speaking with two men on the road to Emmaus the very day he had resurrected.  He kept his identity hidden, but in response to the discussion of recent events "beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself." (Luke 24:27) Oh how I wish all of what He said had been included, but as stated in the book of John 21:25, "Jesus did many other things as well.  If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written."
        That's what this 40 day project is about.  Each day I will provide something that reveals a connection between Jesus and the prophecies, foreshadowing, types, etc.  For your convenience , in most cases, I have included the actual scripture so it does not have to be looked up.  To be mostly consistent in translation, I have chosen the NIV version.  I have gathered from numerous sources, the scriptures that apply.  It is mostly in sequential order but at times I've chosen to follow a theme instead.  May you be blessed as you take this journey with me and the many others who have wondered about the mysteries of these ancient predictions.
        P.S. These are only in draft form.  A lot still has to be tweaked before I put it on my website.  I planned for the 40 days to begin on the day after the Jewish holiday, Purim.  It would begin Thursday March 8th and end a week after Easter, April 16th on the Sunday after Easter.  The 40 days include weekends.  It is exactly 40 days. Some give up something for lent.  Consider adding this meditation for a fuller experience.
        Please let me know if anything needs to be brought to my attention.  I am in the process of learning these things myself. Contact me, Leanet, at

      <p class="devo"><strong>ERP Day 1  Morning of Resurrection, Luke 24:1-8   or Dawn </strong><br><br>
        1)  On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb. 2) They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, 3)  but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. 4) While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them. 5) In their fright the women bowed down with their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, “Why do you look for the living among the dead? 6) He is not here; he has risen!  Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee: 7) ‘The Son of Man must be delivered over to the hands of sinners, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.’ ” 8) Then they remembered his words.
        Soon after Jesus had asked the disciples who they thought he was, Peter clarified, "You are the Messiah, the Son of the Living God." in Matthew 16:16,
        came Matthew 16:21 - "From that time on Jesus began to explain to is disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life."
        So that's what the angels were talking about! "Then they remembered his words."  (Luke 24:8 ) and  the women ran to tell the others! 
      </p>
      <p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Nugget 2.  Resurrection Day at Dusk</strong><br><br>
        Around dusk, Jesus was taking a walk the road to Emmaus.  Why?  It must have been a divine appointment because I have no idea why else he would be seven miles away from Jerusalem.  Also, as soon as he finished his "appointment" he disappeared into thin air later that evening.  I love this record of Jesus going to the place where two very devastated men would be trying to work though what had happened with Jesus over the past several days.  It's like he wanted to surprise them and personally give them an update!  The funny part is that he disguised himself somehow and pretended to know nothing.  And that is so funny to me considering he knew everything about it!  He must have really enjoyed asking, "What news?"  as if he was completely clueless!  Then at the end, he spoke intelligently about how the Jesus they are talking about really did fulfill the Law of Moses and the Prophets and even his own predictions and it ALL NEEDED TO HAPPEN to fulfill Scripture!
        Luke 24:13-27 Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem. They were talking with each other about everything that had happened. As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them; but they were kept from recognizing him. He asked them, “What are you discussing together as you walk along?” They stood still, their faces downcast.
        One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, “Are you the only one visiting Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?” “What things?” he asked.
        “About Jesus of Nazareth,” they replied. “He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people. The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him; but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. And what is more, it is the third day since all this took place. In addition, some of our women amazed us. They went to the tomb early this morning but didn’t find his body. They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive. Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but they did not see Jesus.”
        He said to them, “How foolish you are, and how slow to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Did not the Messiah have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?” And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself."  
      <p class = "devo"><strong>Day 3 ERP  Resurrection Evening Luke 24:28-45</strong><br><br>  
        What happened when the two men on the Emmaus Road invited "this stranger" to their home for dinner?
        28)  As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus continued on as if he were going farther. 29)  But they urged him strongly, “Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over.” So he went in to stay with them. 30)  When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them. 31)  Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight. 32)  They asked each other, “Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?”
        
        33) They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together 34) and saying, “It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.”
        So, from this it is obvious what Jesus had been doing in the afternoon; appearing to Simon!  And who knows what else!  But now the eleven and the two Emmaus road disciples are together and Jesus appears again!
        Their reactions to the women had been disbelief.   When Jesus appeared to the group in person, they were also in disbelief, (vs.37 )- "They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost.  Jesus did three things to prove he was not a ghost:  
        1.  Look at my hands and feet  (vs.39)
        2.  Touch me and see:  a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.
        3.  He ate in front of them.   vs.41) "And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked them, "Do you have anything here to eat?  (vs.42) They have him a piece of broiled fish, (vs.43) and he took it and ate it in their presence.
        44 He said to them, “This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.”
        45 Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures. 
      </p>
      <p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 4 - Jesus in the Law of Moses?</strong><br><br> 
        The Jewish leaders who were often challenging Jesus got this reply when they refused to accept him,
        in John 5:39-40  "You study the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify about me, yet you refuse to come to me that you might have life."
        and John 5:45-46  “But do not think I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, on whom your hopes are set. 46) If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me."
        The first five books of the Bible are known as the law of Moses or the Torah (Hebrew) or Pentateuch (Greek) Jesus said in Luke 24:44-45, "This is what I told you while I was still with you:  Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms. 45)Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures."
        (When Jesus mentions Scripture, it can only be the Old Testament since the New Testament was not yet written)
        Let's pray that in this 40 day Emmaus Road quest that God will "open our minds as well to understand the Scriptures.
        (Feel free to compare with other translations.  I have used the NIV.  But others can be helpful as well.  The Living Bible says in Psalm 119:18-19, "Open my eyes to see wonderful things in your Word. 19) I am but a pilgrim here on earth; how I need a map-and your commands are my chart and guide.")
        Let's begin!
        These are just A FEW examples of Jesus in the books of Moses!  It's just a sneak peek of Jesus throughout all Scripture!
        Genesis 3:15 prophecies about the "seed of the Woman" who will crush the serpent's head while bruising his own heel.  (sound familiar?)
        Exodus 12:3 explains the Passover Lamb and John 19:36 shows one aspect of the fulfillment.
        Leviticus 1-7 sacrificial system is fulfilled in Jesus Hebrews 9:13-14
        Numbers 21:4-9 the one raised up for all to look upon is referred to by Jesus in John 3:14
        Deuteronomy 27 is the law fulfilled in Jesus - Matthew 5:17 
      </p>
      <p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 5 The SEED prophecy:  The Three Patriarchs Wives</strong><br><br>
        The first promise of a coming Messiah through a SEED is in Genesis 3:15.  
        To the serpent, God said, "And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her Seed; He shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.  And when Jesus came, as Isaiah 53:5 says, "He was bruised for our iniquities.  The serpent's head was also bruised at that time.
        Galatians 3:16 explains that the Scripture does not say, "and to seeds," meaning many, but "and to your seed, meaning One, who is Christ."
        SARAH:  The seed or lineage of the Messiah was promised to miraculously come through Abraham's barren wife Sarah and no other woman.  Genesis 17:17-21
        17 Abraham fell facedown; he laughed and said to himself, “Will a son be born to a man a hundred years old? Will Sarah bear a child at the age of ninety?” 18 And Abraham said to God, “If only Ishmael might live under your blessing!” 19 Then God said, “Yes, but your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you will call him Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him. 20 And as for Ishmael, I have heard you: I will surely bless him; I will make him fruitful and will greatly increase his numbers. He will be the father of twelve rulers, and I will make him into a great nation. 21 But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you by this time next year.”
        REBECCA:  Isaac’s Rebecca  who was clearly chosen by the Lord (account in Genesis 24). had a similar problem to Sarah, his mother.
        Genesis 25:21, NLT: Isaac pleaded with the LORD on behalf of his wife, because she was unable to have children. The LORD answered Isaac's prayer, and Rebecca became pregnant with twins.
        They had Esau and Jacob. Jacob received the blessing and was to carry on the lineage.  God renamed him Israel. His wife Rachael was also barren and after many years God allowed her to conceive, and she bore Joseph and Benjamin.  But it was not until Leah, the "unloved" wife, had birthed their fourth son, Judah , and no, this is not a mistake. (Her story is in Genesis 29).
        From him, through Leah, would come the Tribe of Judah from which the SEED of the Messiah would come. Jesus was from the Tribe of Judah. So, God chose Leah, this time, to carry the SEED, and Rachel failed to conceive until after Judah was born, then the womb was opened, and she conceived Joseph and Benjamin. All twelve of their children became the twelve tribes of Israel.
        That's three times already that God revealed how wanted to bring the seed through a specific woman to bear the SEED that would lead to the Messiah.  I'm sure there are many more accounts of how the SEED passed through unlikely women.  But the biggest one is next.
        MARY:  Mary's was the most miraculous of them all, since she had never been with a man. (Matthew 1:18-25) But she was to deliver the Messiah, the seed of a woman, who would bruise the serpent's head, a promise now being fulfilled from way back in the Garden of Eden. (again Genesis 3:15)     


      </p>
      <p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day  6 Exodus/Passover</strong><br><br>
        Exodus 11:4-9 The tenth and final plague that would cause Pharoah to finally give in and release the Hebrew slaves from 400 years of bondage would be more terrifying than any of the others. The death angel was coming for the first born of every family, unless they did as God instructed.  They had to follow God's protocol to the letter.  They were to sacrifice a perfect lamb and put its blood on the sides and tops of door frames of their dwellings, and for those who followed God's protocol, the death angel would pass over and they would be saved from the plague. Once freed from slavery, this became a yearly event to remind themselves of how by following God's instructions, they were spared from death, and were freed from 400 years of bondage.
        This yearly remembrance  would be memorialized as one of the seven Feasts called Passover, because Yahweh/God  passed over those who had the blood on their doorposts.  
        So many things about the Passover Lamb foreshadow the coming Messiah.  It had to be a male first born without blemish. No bone could be broken.  And the temple lamb had to be publicly tied to the altar before being sacrificed.  There are so many parallels if one just takes the time to look.  I will be covering much of those later.
        God also had a protocol for how we would be saved from eternal death, by giving his firstborn, Jesus, to become "the Passover Lamb" for us. He qualified in every way to be the final Passover Lamb. He was called the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world for a reason.  The blood of THIS LAMB causes the certainty of "spiritual death" and God's judgment to pass over us.

      </p>
      <p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 7 Leviticus</strong><br><br>
        In Leviticus chapters 1-7, God instructs Moses on how the sacrificial system is to be run with priests and the tabernacle.  I've heard that's a fantastic study in itself!  It would be worth looking into how Jesus is symbolized in the tabernacle.  That is too extensive to be included in this study, but Jesus IS our SACRIFICE, HIGH PRIEST, and TABERNACLE of a better kind.
        Hebrews 9:11-14  But when Christ came as high priest of the good things that are now already here, he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that is not made with human hands, that is to say, is not a part of this creation. 12 He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves; but he entered the Most Holy Place once for all by his own blood, thus obtaining eternal redemption. 13 The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ceremonially unclean sanctify them so that they are outwardly clean. 14 How much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death so that we may serve the living God!
        Instructions for The Feasts of the Lord are written In Leviticus 23, 1) The Lord said to Moses, 2 “Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘These are my appointed festivals, the appointed festivals of the Lord, which you are to proclaim as sacred assemblies.
        This chapter covers the feasts and festivals:  The Sabbath,The Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread, Offering the Firstfruits, The Festival of Weeks/Pentecost, Feasts of Trumpets, The Day of Atonement, The Festival of Tabernacles or Booths.
        In the hebrew language,  the word FEASTS is pronounced "moedim" and means an appointment (a fixed time or season), an appointed time, an assembly (of a congregation), a place of meeting, a signal (as appointed beforehand) and convocations:  In hebrew the word is pronounced "mikra" means a rehearsal - an assembly, calling, reading.
        "If you place these definitions in the context of these verses Leviticus 23:1-2 it would sound like this:  "And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, "Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them:  The appointed (beforehand) times and seasons of the LORD, which you shall proclaim to be holy public meetings and rehearsals, these are my appointed (beforehand) times and seasons.
        "One of the most exciting revelations of the Bible is that the Feasts of the Lord are rehearsals for the Messiah's coming to earth.  The traditions and rituals within each of the Feasts are symbolic of specific events which would occur during the Messiah's advents to earth...As we compare the traditions of the Spring Feast to actual events that happened at the end of Jesus' ministry on earth, we see that He perfectly fulfilled the rehearsals in the Spring Feasts to the very day and hour as they occur on the ancient biblical/Jewish calendar."  (quote by Voice of Judah)  
        According to many resources, the Spring Feasts have already been fulfilled in Jesus.  He died at the exact time the temple passover lamb was being sacrificed.  He removed  sin during Unleavened Bread where it is every Jewish person's job was to remove all leaven from their home.  This ceremony is to symbolically remove all sin from the home.  And Jesus resurrected on First Fruits.  
        Pentecost was also fulfilled.  Fifty days after the passover in Egypt, Moses, on Mount Sinai, was given the Law.  
        Fifty days after Jesus became the Passover Lamb, The Holy Spirit was given.  
        The four Fall Feast rehearsals are still waiting to be fulfilled!
      </p>
      <p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 8 Numbers</strong><br><br>
        Numbers is a record of the 40 years in the desert along with all the drama!  The people had spoken badly about God's leader Moses so many times.  Every time they got into big trouble with God, Moses prayed for them.  But their sins against God and Moses did not go without very hard consequences. 
        The wrath of God had come to a head when they just would not stop insulting God and Moses.  He had been tested enough.  Even though God had provided  sandals that miraculously never wore out, manna from heaven, quail, clean water where there was none, "they spoke against God and against Moses, and said, "Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness?  There is no bread:  There is no water? And we detest this miserable food"! (referring to the Mana)
        God had heard enough! 
        Numbers 21:6-9 "Then the Lord sent venomous snakes among them; they bit the people and many Israelites died. The people came to Moses and said, “We sinned when we spoke against the Lord and against you. Pray that the Lord will take the snakes away from us.” So, Moses prayed for the people. The Lord said to Moses, “Make a snake and put it up on a pole; anyone who is bitten can look at it and live.” So Moses made a bronze snake and put it up on a pole. Then when anyone was bitten by a snake and looked at the bronze snake, they lived.
        Not sure I understand the back story on this, but Jesus referred to himself as the Manna from heaven and referred to this incident as well.
        John 6:3-33 Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written: ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’” Jesus said to them, “Very truly I tell you, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is the bread that comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.” ...(vs. 41) At this the Jews there began to grumble about him because he said, "I am the bread that came down from heaven...(vs. 43) "Stop grumbling among yourselves," Jesus answered."
        In an earlier spot, Jesus said, "For my Father’s will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day.” (vs. 40)
        John 3:14-15 Jesus referred to Moses again, "Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him."

      </p>
      <p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 9 Deuteronomy Test</strong><br><br>
        "Deuteronomy is a single long discourse by Moses. In the gospel of Matthew, the temptations are followed by the Sermon on the Mount, a single long discourse by Jesus, in which he explains the deepest meanings and applications of the law."  (goodquestionblog.com)
        According to an article by Mark D. Futato's:  The Gospel in Deuteronomy,  "Jesus quoted the book of Deuteronomy in his own life more than any other book in the Old Testament."
        Right before The Temptation came the Baptism. When Jesus told John the baptizer to go ahead and baptize him, John was reluctant saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?" (Matthew 3:14)  That makes sense because Jesus did not need to repent of anything.  (Hebrews 4:15)   For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet he did not sin."  He passed every test that he went through. But in Matthew 3:15, concerning whether or not he should be baptized, Jesus replied, "Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness."

 
      </p>
      <p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 10:  The Prophets: Part one</strong><br><br>
        We have looked at examples of how Jesus is seen in the Law of Moses, the First five books of the Bible, or Pentateuch.  Jesus said we would also find him in the Prophets.
        Isaiah 9:1,6,7...but in the future he will honor Galilee of the nations, by the Way of the Sea, beyond the Jordan. (remember the Jordan River?)  The people walking in darkness have seen a great light...vs. 6 - For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.  Of the greatness of his government and peace there will be no end.  He will reign of David's throne and over his kingdom, establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness from that time on and forever.  The zeal of the Lord Almighty will accomplish this."
        When Jesus' family was called out of Egypt and directed to Galilee where Jesus would grow up, he did at least 37 recorded specific miracles there.  Though we are aware that he healed hundreds if not thousands when groups came to him.  He grew up in Nazareth of Galilee, but was born in Bethlehem according to prophecy.  Galilee was a huge part of his ministry.
        Isaiah 11:1-2 “ A shoot will come up from the stump of Jesse; from his roots a Branch will bear fruit. The Spirit of the Lord will rest on him— the Spirit of wisdom and of understanding, the Spirit of counsel and of might, the Spirit of the knowledge and fear of the Lord -"
        Romans 15:12 "And again, Isaiah says, "The Root of Jesse will spring up, one who will arise to rule over the nations; in him the Gentiles will hope."
        Revelation 22:16 "I am the Root and Offspring of David, and the bright Morning Star"
        Jesus life is also foreshadowed in Jeremiah 31:15 and Matthew 2:16-28,  Hosea 11:1 and Matthew 2:14-15, Zechariah 9:9 and Mark 11:7-11, and MIcah 5:2 and Luke 2:4-6, but these will be explained later in the study.

      <p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 11- The Prophets:  Part Two Isaiah 53: 1-6</strong><br><br>
        This can be read as is or one can take the time to look up the verses I have included.
        1) Who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?
        2) He grew up before him like a tender shoot, and like a root out of dry ground.  (Isaiah 11:1 )
        He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire.
        3) He was despised and rejected by mankind, a man of suffering, and familiar with pain.  (Acts 26:22-23) Like one from whom people hide their faces, he was despised, and we held him in low esteem.
        4) Surely he took up our pain and bore our suffering, yet we considered him punished by God, stricken by him, and afflicted.  
        5) But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed. (Psalm 103:3)
        6) We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to our own way; and the Lord has laid on him

        Feel free just to read or look up references.  
        7)  He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth; he was led like a lamb to the slaughter,  and as a sheep before its shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth. (Matthew 27:14)
        8)  By oppression and judgment he was taken away. Yet who of his generation protested? For he was cut off from the land of the living; for the transgression of my people he was punished. (1 Peter 3:18)
        9)  He was assigned a grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death, though he had done no violence,     nor was any deceit in his mouth. (John 19:38-40)
        10) Yet it was the Lord’s will to crush him and cause him to suffer, and though the Lord makes his life an offering for sin, he will see his offspring and prolong his days, and the will of the Lord will prosper in his hand. (Hebrews 12:2)
        11)  After he has suffered, he will see the light of life and be satisfied; by his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many, and he will bear their iniquities. (1 Peter 2:24)
        12)  Therefore I will give him a portion among the great, and he will divide the spoils with the strong, because he poured out his life unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors. For he bore the sin of many,     and made intercession for the transgressors. (Luke 23:34)

      <p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 13 The Scepter</strong><br><br>
        Jesus first came as a suffering servant as prophesied, but he is also King and we must never forget that.  He carries a Scepter.
        Scepter:  a full-length staff that symbolizes a ruler's absolute power and authority over a tribe or nation.  It is sometimes translated as club or rod, both of which can be used as weapons.
        Numbers 24:17,19 "I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near.  A star will come out of Jacob; a scepter will rise out of Israel...a ruler will come out of Jacob..."
        The Line of Judah would become the royal line, starting with David all the way to Zedekiah, the last earthly king of Judah.  Jacob's prophecy came true:  the tribe of Judah possessed the scepter. The kings of the Davidic dynasty were all descended from Jacob's/ Israel's fourth son, Judah.  But, 2 Samuel 7:3-16 also indicates that this throne will be eternal.  Some more literal translations, such as the KJV and the NASB, render the prophecy as "until Shiloh comes" - Shiloh being the title of the Messiah.
        In Jacob's/Israel's blessing of his twelve sons, he says about Judah in Genesis 49:10, "The scepter will not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, until he to whom it belongs shall come and the obedience of the nations shall be his."
        Hebrews 1:8-9 "But about the Son he says, 'Your throne, O God, will last forever and ever; a scepter of justice will be the scepter of your kingdom. You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy. (also in Psalm 45:6-7)
        In Revelation 19:15 we see the eternal King coming back:  "Coming out of his mouth is a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations. "He will rule them with an iron scepter."
        Roman soldiers made fun of the idea that Jesus was a king by placing a crown of thorns on His head and a weak reed or fake staff to represent a royal scepter with which they struck him repeatedly. I would not want to be them when he returns with the real scepter at the second coming!
        And they will see him. Revelation 1:7 - "Look, he is coming with the clouds," and "every eye will see him, even those who pierced him"; and all peoples of the earth "will mourn because of him."
        Psalm 2:1-12
        Why do the nations conspire and the peoples plot in vain?  The kings of the earth rise up and the rulers band together against the Lord and against his anointed, saying,  “Let us break their chains and throw off their shackles.” The One enthroned in heaven laughs;  the Lord scoffs at them. He rebukes them in his anger and terrifies them in his wrath, saying, “I have installed my king on Zion, my holy mountain.” I will proclaim the Lord’s decree: He said to me, “You are my son; today I have become your father. Ask me, and I will make the nations your inheritance, the ends of the earth your possession. You will break them with a rod of iron; you will dash them to pieces like pottery.” Therefore, you kings, be wise; be warned, you rulers of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear and celebrate his rule with trembling. Kiss his son, or he will be angry and your way will lead to your destruction, for his wrath can flare up in a moment.  Blessed are all who take refuge in him.

      <p class = "devo"><strong>Emmaus Road Project:  Day 14  Psalm 22</strong><br><br>
        In Matthew 27:46 Jesus cried out something while suffering. Was he only calling out to God in desperation or could there have been more to it?
        At that time, God's word had not been separated into chapters and verses. When someone wanted to bring up a scripture, they would quote the first part of it, and the listener would know which one they were talking about.
        Psalm 22: 1-18
        1) My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? Why are you so far from saving me, so far from my cries of anguish?
        2 My God, I cry out by day, but you do not answer, by night, but I find no rest.
        3 Yet you are enthroned as the Holy One; you are the one Israel praises. 
        4 In you our ancestors put their trust; they trusted and you delivered them.
        5 To you they cried out and were saved; in you they trusted and were not put to shame.
        6 But I am a worm and not a man, scorned by everyone, despised by the people.
        7 All who see me mock me; they hurl insults, shaking their heads.
        8 “He trusts in the Lord,” they say, “let the Lord rescue him. Let him deliver him, since he delights in him.”
        9 Yet you brought me out of the womb; you made me trust in you, even at my mother’s breast.
        10 From birth I was cast on you; from my mother’s womb you have been my God.
        11 Do not be far from me, for trouble is near and there is no one to help.
        12 Many bulls surround me; strong bulls of Bashan encircle me.
        13 Roaring lions that tear their prey open their mouths wide against me.
        14 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint. My heart has turned to wax; it has melted within me.
        15 My mouth[d] is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth; you lay me in the dust of death.
        16 Dogs surround me, a pack of villains encircles me; they pierce my hands and my feet.
        17 All my bones are on display; people stare and gloat over me.
        18 They divide my clothes among them and cast lots for my garment.
        So, could it be he was leading the people to reference the ancient Scriptures in which he is found?  In the middle of all of this he yells out Psalm 22.

      <p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 15 Family Tree</strong><br><br>
        The lineage of Abraham includes many names we are familiar with , like Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah, David with references to "the star of Jacob, the Root of Jesse,  and the branch of David.  All are descriptive of the Messiah coming out of the family line, Genealogy, or family tree:
        Take a minute to look through these lists. Do you recognize names in either or both that you'd not thought about before?  
        List One:  Matthew 1:1-16 Starting with Abraham and leading up to the Messiah.  
        God said in Genesis 12:3 "I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse, and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you."  
        This is already being fulfilled and will continue to grow. Revelation 7:9 reads,  "After this I looked, and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands."
        Referring to the genealogy in Matthew, verse 17 reads, " Thus there were fourteen generations in all from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen from the exile to the Messiah.
        List Two:  Luke 3:23-38 is the genealogy of Jesus through the head of his house, Joseph, starting where they were and going backwards to Adam.  
        Jesus was regularly referred to as "The Son of David" and "The Son of God.  He was also referred to as "Son of Man."  Can you think of more names he went by?  If you're curious enough to look them up you may just discover why he had those titles and what they meant to him!

      <p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 16 Prophecies Beyond Jesus' Control</strong><br><br>
        "Born, bo-orn in, Born in Bethlehem!  the old song goes. (Go where I send Thee...How shall I send thee)
        Anyway, We as  embryos have no say in where we are born.  While in the womb, we just go where mama takes us for 9 months!
        Long ago, the birthplace of the coming Messiah was predicted in Micah 5:2
        “But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah,  though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old,  from ancient times.”
        Mary and Joseph lived in Nazareth. The only reason they went to Bethlehem was because Joseph was in the lineage of King David and needed to register in his hometown at that time.  Why else would they travel at such an inconvenient time?   Hence, the baby Jesus came forth from the womb of Mary in the place where this "ruler over Israel whose origins are from old, from ancient times' was to be born.  (Oh, I've heard this before.  Oh yeah.  In the Scripture above Micah 5:2)
        Some interesting people and events were associated with this area:
        In the Old Testament, Bethlehem was an early Canaanite settlement connected with the patriarchs.  Jacob's favorite wife, Rachel, was buried in this area.  (Genesis 35:19)  
        It was here in young David's hometown that the prophet Samuel anointed him to be king over Israel (1 Samuel 16:1-13).
        The poignant story of Naomi, Ruth, and Boaz from the book of Ruth is set primarily around the town of Bethlehem. King David, the great-grandson of Ruth and Boaz was born and raised in Bethlehem, and there David's mighty men lived. Bethlehem eventually came to be called the City of David as the symbol of his great dynasty. It grew into an important, strategic, and fortified city under King Rehoboam. (Historic Info from an article by Mary Fairchild, updated on September 14, 2020)  
        Now, it makes sense why Jesus was sometimes referred to as the Son of David.
        Also, Bethlehem means "House of Bread"  The bun in the oven "was actually the Bread of Life" born in the "House of Bread!"
        Many of the prophecies about the first and second coming of The Messiah were completely out of Jesus' control.  His lineage, his birthplace, where he would grow up, how people would treat him.  He also made predictions about himself that came true that were beyond his control.  Many of those will be pointed out in the next few studies.

	  <p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day  17 Galilee</strong><br><br>
After Jesus' family was warned in a dream to flee to Egypt to escape Herod's wrath, they were directed by God to move to Galilee.
This had been prophesied long ago in Isaiah 9:1,6,7...but in the future he will honor Galilee of the nations, by the Way of the Sea, beyond Jordan. (remember the Jordan River?)  The people walking in darkness have seen a great light...vs. 6 - For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders.  And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.  Of the greatness of his government and peace there will be no end.  He will reign of David's throne and over his kingdom, establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness from that time on and forever.  The zeal of the Lord Almighty will accomplish this."
So the family was called out of Egypt and directed to Galilee where Jesus did at least 37 recorded miracles.  
I won't attempt to cover all of what happened in Jesus' life, but there were many wonderful and amazing friendships, followers, laughs, learning, ministry, travel, miracles, wisdom, etc.  Jesus went off by himself to pray often as well. </p>
	  <p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 18 Forerunner</strong><br><br>
The Messiah's forerunner came through another woman who was past the age of conceiving. The husband who would be the father of this forerunner was a high priest and did not believe the angel's promise so was struck mute until his son was born.  His voice came back when he blurted out, "His name is John.' the name the angel gave him regarding his son who would prepare the way for the Messiah.
Luke 1:41-45  When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. In a loud voice she exclaimed: “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear! But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. Blessed is she who has believed that the Lord would fulfill his promises to her!”
John 1:14-15 The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth. John testified concerning him. He cried out, saying, “This is the one I spoke about when I said, ‘He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.’”Why would the forerunner John say this? He was physically born before Jesus. It looks as though he may have understood Christ's deity.
Luke 3:2-6 During the high-priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the wilderness. He went into all the country around Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet: “A voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him. Every valley shall be filled in, every mountain and hill made low. The crooked roads shall become straight, the rough ways smooth. And all people will see God’s salvation.’” (That was from Isaiah 40:3) </p> 

	  <p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 19 Parables</strong><br><br>

Matthew 13:34-35
Jesus  spoke all these things to the crowd in parables; he did not say anything to them without using a parable.  So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet:
“I will open my mouth in parables,  I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world.”
Psalms 78 and Matthew 13:35 speaking in parables
Psalm 78:2 uses the word parable (masal).  It means comparison, i.e., a saying which uses one realm of life to illuminate another." (Kinder) ee. Mathew 13:35 quotes Psalm 78:2 as a prophecy of the way Jesus would teach.  (Psalm 78:2 - I will open my mouth with a parable; I will utter hidden things, things from of old—)  
Asaph, the poet, singer, prophet in Solomon's era went on to say something that could also apply to us today, so let's look at Psalm 78:1-8:  "My people, hear my teaching; listen to the words of my mouth. I will open my mouth with a parable; I will utter hidden things, things from of old— things we have heard and known, things our ancestors have told us.  We will not hide them from their descendants; we will tell the next generation the praiseworthy deeds of the LORD, his power, and the wonders he has done.  He decreed statutes for Jacob and established the law in Israel, which he commanded our ancestors to teach their children, so the next generation would know them, even the children yet to be born, and they in turn would tell their children. Then they would put their trust in God and would not forget his deeds but would keep his commands. They would not be like their ancestors— a stubborn and rebellious generation, whose hearts were not loyal to God, whose spirits were not faithful to him. </p>
	  <p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 20 Jesus reads the scroll about himself</strong><br><br>
Luke 4:14-21"Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about him spread through the whole countryside. He was teaching in their synagogues, and everyone praised him. He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom. He stood up to read, and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written: “The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.”  
Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him. He began by saying to them, “Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.”
His reading was from Isaiah 61:1 </p>
	  <p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 21 Baptism</strong><br><br>
        (Many say the word "baptize" is not in the Old Testament, therefore it's a thing Jesus instated.  Where in a way, this act was an example for his believers to follow, it wasn't a new thing.  According to the jewishencyclopedia.com and Kaufmann Kohler & Samuel Krauss, Baptism was "A religious ablution signifying purification or consecration. The natural method of cleansing the body by washing and bathing in water was always customary in Israel (see Ablution, Bathing). The washing of their clothes was an important means of sanctification enjoined on the Israelites before the Revelation on Mt. Sinai (Ex. xix. 10). The Rabbis connect with this the duty of bathing by complete immersion ("ṭebilah," Yeb. 46b; Mek., Baḥodesh, iii.); and since sprinkling with blood was always accompanied by immersion, tradition connects with this immersion the blood lustration mentioned as having also taken place immediately before the Revelation (Ex. xxiv. 8), these three acts being the initiatory rites always performed upon proselytes, "to bring them under the wings of the Shekinah" (Yeb. l.c.)." 
        So much happened at  Jesus' baptism. (Matthew 3)  He was immersed, had at least three witnesses confirming he is God's Son:  John, the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him, and a voice from heaven that said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
        After this confirmation, came Matthew 4:1 "Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. After fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry."
        In every case, Jesus quoted from the Book of Deuteronomy in context in order to resist the devil, and Jesus passed the test. Deuteronomy 8:3"...man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord."  Deuteronomy 6:13 - "Fear the Lord your God, serve him only..."(vs.6) “Do not put the Lord your God to the test..."  Luke 4:4...Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone.’... (vs. 8) “It is written: ‘Worship the Lord your God and serve him only...(vs. 12) Jesus answered, “It is said: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test."   
        Jesus passed the test and "From that time on Jesus began to preach, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near." (Matthew 4:17)
        In Matthew 5:17, Jesus said, “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.

	  <p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day  23 Claims to Be equal with God</strong><br><br>
God called himself, I AM in Exodus 3:14..  Jesus when addressing the Jewish leaders in John 8:56-59, "our father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was glad.”  "You are not yet fifty years old,” they said to him, “and you have seen Abraham!”  “Very truly I tell you,” Jesus answered, “before Abraham was born, I am!”  At this, they picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus hid himself, slipping away from the temple grounds.
He also said, in John 10:30-31, "I and the Father are one."  The Jews took up stones again to stone Him.
They did this because they were assuming he was committing blasphemy, claiming equality with God.  But if he was God then it was NOT blasphemy.  Those who say Jesus did not claim to be God do not understand that this is the main reason the Jewish leaders had him crucified.  They did not believe he was who He said.
His disciples and many others did believe.  John 1:1-5 clearly testifies this in speaking of Jesus, The Word:  " In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind.  The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it." This teaching continues through the first chapter of John.
 </p>
	  <p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 24 Palms & Fists</strong><br><br>
Jesus told the disciples ahead of time what would happen to him but it didn't sink in.  He continued to gain great popularity and before long crowds were waving palm branches and making a path for "Hosana" as he rode a donkey down the path fulfilling the prophecy from Zechariah 9:9, ".Rejoice greatly, Daughter Zion! Shout, Daughter Jerusalem! See, your king comes to you, righteous and victorious, lowly and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey."
Six days later in Matthew 27:22-25:  "What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called the Messiah?” Pilate asked. They all answered, “Crucify him!” “Why? What crime has he committed?” asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, “Crucify him!” When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. “I am innocent of this man’s blood,” he said. “It is your responsibility!” All the people answered, “His blood is on us and on our children!”
At Penticost Peter addressed  them (Acts 2:36-39)  “Therefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah.” When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, “Brothers, what shall we do?”Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off—for all whom the Lord our God will call.” </p>
	  <p class = "devo"><strong>ERP Day 25- Premeditated Betrayal</strong><br><br>
Matthew 26:14-15  "Then one of the Twelve—the one called Judas Iscariot—went to the chief priests and asked, “What are you willing to give me if I deliver him over to you?” So they counted out thirty pieces of silver.
Matthew 27:3-10  "When Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders. “I have sinned,” he said, “for I have betrayed innocent blood.” “What is that to us?” they replied. “That’s your responsibility.” So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself. The chief priests picked up the coins and said, “It is against the law to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money.” So they decided to use the money to buy the potter’s field as a burial place for foreigners. That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day. Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled:
“They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price set on him by the people of Israel, and they used them to buy the potter’s field, as the Lord commanded me.” (referring to Jeremiah 19:1-13)
Zechariah 11:13 "And the Lord said to me, “Throw it to the potter”—the handsome price at which they valued me! So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them to the potter at the house of the Lord.
Judas would also break bread at the Last Supper with Jesus and His disciples and fulfill Psalm 41:9 - "Even my close friend, someone I trusted, one who shared my bread,has turned against me." </p>
