      <p class="mainp">If there ever were a mixed bag of original songs this would be it.  But good things come in bunches and variety.  Think of a pinata.  You never know what you're going to get and each item is so different.
When it comes to memorizing things, sometimes the more odd, the better.  It tends to stick.
Some of the background is either acapella, a mix I came up with on my free Garageband app, or a non-copyrighted background track.
Some of the lyrics come straight from scripture.  Some are inspired by things I've experienced or started with poems I wrote in my time with the Lord.
Some songs are good for seriously soothing the soul, like "Nightwatch."  Some are meditative and deep and need to be carefully listened to to the end, like "Job's Confession."  I also like to sneak in a lot of surprise harmony in the middle or the end.  The words are very important but I also believe in letting the music have a turn to sing as well.  Some of these songs are playful like I am.
Some are a tool for memorizing scripture and I have memorized so much, even long sections of Jesus' words because of this method.
If you hear or see something you love please let me know.  If you see one that's a little too odd, I can put it in the odds and ends section.  Or maybe you like, odd!
I originally felt called to do this because we were studying the persecuted church and they often had scripture taken away from them.  I never want to be without the Word of God if something like that were to happen.  In the movie, Eli (spoiler alert) the sacred book would have never made it if he had not committed it to memory and carried it safely within his mind and heart, later to be dictated and copied again by an able person in order to continue it's influence.
Be sure to check out the different pages available like Videos, Audios, Thoughts, Odds and Ends page, and especially the Emmaus Road 40 Day Devotional! Maybe you'll find a favorite place to hang out.

  
Pray for this, that God will use this website to make a difference in the world and may it bless and cheer you.
A big shout out to Laren who made this website for me!  I hope this inspires some to put old or new poems to music or to use the area they are gifted in to make a difference! </p>
